# Git Notes

Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in files. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project and easily manage their code.

## Git Commands

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
- `git clone [repository URL]`: Creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.
- `git add [file]`: Adds a file or changes to the staging area for the next commit.
- `git commit -m "[commit message]"`: Commits the changes in the staging area with a descriptive message.
- `git status`: Shows the current status of the repository, including modified files and untracked files.
- `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
- `git push`: Pushes committed changes to a remote repository.
